## 5. The Orionix (ORX) Token

### 5.1. What is Orionix?
Orionix (ORX) is a custom ERC-20 token created for the Crypto-Platform ecosystem. It is designed for fast, secure, and low-fee transactions, and can be used for platform fees, governance, and exclusive features.

### 5.2. How was ORX created?
- **Smart Contract**: Written in Solidity, following the ERC-20 standard.
- **Deployment**: Deployed on the Ethereum Sepolia Testnet for development and testing.
- **Initial Supply**: 1,000,000 ORX tokens, fixed supply.
- **Security**: The contract is immutable and verified on Etherscan.
- **Ownership**: The contract owner can renounce ownership for full decentralization.

#### Example (Solidity):
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

contract Orionix is ERC20 {
    constructor() ERC20("Orionix", "ORX") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 1_000_000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

### 5.3. What can ORX do?
